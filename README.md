APEX-Simulator
A cycle-by-cycle simulator for an in-order APEX pipeline with three different function units.
Summary
The Integer FU has a latency of 1 cycle and implements all operations that involve integer arithmetic (ADD, SUB, ADDC, address computation of LOADs and STOREs etc.)
The MUL (for multiply) instruction, which is a register-to-register instruction like the ADD, uses two pipeline stages in sequence, MUL1 and MUL2, each with a one cycle latency.
The DIV ( for division ) instruction uses four pipeline stages in sequence
Registers and Memory
Registers Use of 16 architectural registers, R0 through R15.

Memory Memory for data is viewed as a linear array of integer values (4 Bytes wide). Data memory ranges from 0 through 3999 and memory addresses correspond to a Byte address that begins the first Byte of the 4-Byte group that makes up a 4 Byte data item.

Instruction Set:
The instructions supported are:
Register-to-register instructions: ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, MOVC, AND, OR, EX-OR (all done on the Integer ALU).
MOVC , moves literal value into specified register. The MOVC uses the ALU stages to add 0 to the literal and updates the destination register from the WB stage.
Memory instructions: LOAD, STORE - both include a literal value whose content is added to a register to compute the memory address.
Control flow instructions: BZ, BNZ, JUMP, JAL and HALT. Instructions following a BZ, BNZ, JAL and JUMP instruction in the pipeline will be flushed on a taken branch.
Data Forwarding
The forwarding happens at the end of the clock cycle when the instruction producing the results (including flag values) are in final stages of the respective FUs (integer, multiplier, divider). If the forwarded result(s) is/are the only source data that the instruction in D/RF was waiting for, it can be issued at the beginning of the clock cycle that immediately follows the one when forwarding took place.

Forwarding bus This structure will store data forwarded from execute stage to decode stage. The stored data is then read in decode stage. The struct has 3 fields register number, value and status

Working
The project uses a bottom up approach, where writeback stage is executed first followed by memory , execute, decode and fetch.
Each stage will have its own buffer space where it can store currently processed instruction.
When a instruction enters into execute stage it will use the executer_buffer class array to append the current instruction in its first cycle. On the next cycle it will append another instruction ( if there is any ) to the array and send the instruction to memory stage based on priority , DIV -> MUL -> ALLOTHERINSTRUCTIONS.
